Pls install Eclipse IDE for Java Developers

Try to open it and try to create a java project in it

Try to create a Java class and run a java program

If it is working. you are ready to go
=========================================

If the program is not working, then Pls make sure you have Java installed in your laptop

version >=11 

=============================================================================

Manual Testing
========================

12 am

20 tersters --> 20000 customer forms --> to check if 20000 accounts are created or not

Easy task? -> No

tedious, repetitive

10 hours -> time consuming

skip certain functionalities from testing

Tester assume that feature will work, any may skip scenarios

May ignore certain use cases

human error 



To overcome these challenges-> Automation tools/Testing

Whenever we have:
> repetitive tasks, time consuming tasks
> regression Tests
> lot of testing for same feature every day


Everyday --> 3 PM we get a new Build in the test envrionment-->Regression testing
Instead of manually doing this regression testing, we can have an automation tool
to run those simple test cases as soon as the build is deployed in test environment

I have some test cases to be run at 11 PM--> we can use an automation tool and write automation tests--> scehdule them to ru   at 11 pm --> generate the report for you

When you have same test to be run with different test data --> i can use an automation tool --. write automation tests--> send different test data to my automation tests

You want to test performance/load of your application --> use automation tools

When you lot of test cases to be run--> use automationt ool to complete testing

time taken to complete testing is less with automation tool

Automation tool:
==================

Selenium --> Web application Functional testing tool

Introduced year - 2004 -> JASON Huggins --> selenium1 --> 2008(selenium 2) --> 2016(Selenium 3)--> 2021(selenium 4)

It is an Open source tool and free tool

Selenium is to do functional testing/regression testing of web application

Selenium + Applium --> used for Mobile application testing

Selenium WebDriver is the component used for writing automation scripts
Its does not have a front -end, so you have to write test scripts

Script : what automation test steps shoudl selenium perform

These scripts can be written in -> JAVA, pyhton, ruby, C#, php

Selenium also has component IDE -> which has a UI

Selenium supports testing on all the browser -> Cross browser testing: Chrome, Edge, ff, safari

It is a stack of tools

1. Selenium IDE : Integrated devlopment environment
==================================================
It can downloaded on chrome browser as an extension
https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/

Features:
==============================
It supports testing on Chrome and firefox browser
It is record and playback tool
It records users actions and you save that as a test
Play it back as many times as you want
Simple and easy to work with
The log section will show test step is success or failure
At the end in log you will get test executed successfully or it failed
Suitable for testers who are new automation
Who donot know how to write code

============================
Disadvantages:

Every time the test case will run with same test data
passing multiple test data is not possible with IDE
Everytime any new test case we have to manually record
We dont have advance features like:

> Wait times
> Paramterized testing
> Data driven not allowed
> No reports are generated
> no scheduling of scripts 
> pritoritze test cases
> pre-condition, post condition
=================================================

2. Selenium WebDriver
==================================================
Selenium Webdriver is the main component of Selenium- where we will do exhaustive automation testing.
This component has to user interface rather it has selenium libraries which needs to be added in your eclipse
Usinng webdriver libraries you will selenium scripts
Every programming lanaguge supported by selenium will have its corresponding selenium webdriver libraries

Selenium webdriver provides interfaces, classes and methods that help us find the element to be tested and automatically perform as action
 What ever we did in IDE manually, we will do via code in webdriver

Features:
==================
> supports testing on all browser
> Wait times
> Paramterized testing
Integrate Webdriver with tools like testNG and cucumber that enhances the fetaures of selenium webdriver
> Data driven testing
> pritoritze test cases
> pre-condition, post condition
> reports generation

Because of W3C prootocal with Selenium 4:

> tets cases run faster as there is no need to Encode or decode the scripts
> Testing is more consistent and works better on croass browser
> browser specific exception --> now we dont get those with selenium 4
>No need to download drivers in the system --> webDriver Manager -> it will automatically download each driver and works with all browser


3. Selenium GRID
=======================

Grid is that component of selenium which is used only for execution

We dont write sscripts using grid

If you want to execute test cases in distributed environment-> use grid

===========================================

Go to File --> New--> select project --> select maven project

A new maven project template will open

Click on checkbox for - create simple project

Un check default workspace

from the frop down select  toption ending with eclipse workspace

If you dont find it then select it by clicking on Browse button

Click on checkbox og workspace

Press Next button

Enter a unique name for Group ID: selenium-Basics

Artifact ID : selenium-Basics

Always Artifact ID and group id will be same

Click on finish 


In the project Explorer, you will see your maven project

Expand the project now

You will see a file called --> pom.xml file

Double click and open the file
