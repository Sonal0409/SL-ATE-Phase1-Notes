Pls install Eclipse IDE for Java Developers

Try to open it and try to create a java project in it

Try to create a Java class and run a java program

If it is working. you are ready to go
=========================================

If the program is not working, then Pls make sure you have Java installed in your laptop

version >=11 

=============================================================================

Manual Testing
========================

12 am

20 tersters --> 20000 customer forms --> to check if 20000 accounts are created or not

Easy task? -> No

tedious, repetitive

10 hours -> time consuming

skip certain functionalities from testing

Tester assume that feature will work, any may skip scenarios

May ignore certain use cases

human error 



To overcome these challenges-> Automation tools/Testing

Whenever we have:
> repetitive tasks, time consuming tasks
> regression Tests
> lot of testing for same feature every day


Everyday --> 3 PM we get a new Build in the test envrionment-->Regression testing
Instead of manually doing this regression testing, we can have an automation tool
to run those simple test cases as soon as the build is deployed in test environment

I have some test cases to be run at 11 PM--> we can use an automation tool and write automation tests--> scehdule them to ru   at 11 pm --> generate the report for you

When you have same test to be run with different test data --> i can use an automation tool --. write automation tests--> send different test data to my automation tests

You want to test performance/load of your application --> use automation tools

When you lot of test cases to be run--> use automationt ool to complete testing

time taken to complete testing is less with automation tool

Automation tool:
==================

Selenium --> Web application Functional testing tool

Introduced year - 2004 -> JASON Huggins --> selenium1 --> 2008(selenium 2) --> 2016(Selenium 3)--> 2021(selenium 4)

It is an Open source tool and free tool

Selenium is to do functional testing/regression testing of web application

Selenium + Applium --> used for Mobile application testing

Selenium WebDriver is the component used for writing automation scripts
Its does not have a front -end, so you have to write test scripts

Script : what automation test steps shoudl selenium perform

These scripts can be written in -> JAVA, pyhton, ruby, C#, php

Selenium also has component IDE -> which has a UI

Selenium supports testing on all the browser -> Cross browser testing: Chrome, Edge, ff, safari

It is a stack of tools

1. Selenium IDE : Integrated devlopment environment
==================================================
It can downloaded on chrome browser as an extension
https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/

Features:
==============================
It supports testing on Chrome and firefox browser
It is record and playback tool
It records users actions and you save that as a test
Play it back as many times as you want
Simple and easy to work with
The log section will show test step is success or failure
At the end in log you will get test executed successfully or it failed
Suitable for testers w
ho are new automation
Who donot know how to write code

============================
Disadvantages:

Every time the test case will run with same test data
passing multiple test data is not possible with IDE
Everytime any new test case we have to manually record
We dont have advance features like:

> Wait times
> Paramterized testing
> Data driven not allowed
> No reports are generated
> no scheduling of scripts 
> pritoritze test cases
> pre-condition, post condition
=================================================

2. Selenium WebDriver
==================================================
Selenium Webdriver is the main component of Selenium- where we will do exhaustive automation testing.
This component has to user interface rather it has selenium libraries which needs to be added in your eclipse
Usinng webdriver libraries you will selenium scripts
Every programming lanaguge supported by selenium will have its corresponding selenium webdriver libraries

Selenium webdriver provides interfaces, classes and methods that help us find the element to be tested and automatically perform as action
 What ever we did in IDE manually, we will do via code in webdriver

Features:
==================
> supports testing on all browser
> Wait times
> Paramterized testing
Integrate Webdriver with tools like testNG and cucumber that enhances the fetaures of selenium webdriver
> Data driven testing
> pritoritze test cases
> pre-condition, post condition
> reports generation

Because of W3C prootocal with Selenium 4:

> tets cases run faster as there is no need to Encode or decode the scripts
> Testing is more consistent and works better on croass browser
> browser specific exception --> now we dont get those with selenium 4
>No need to download drivers in the system --> webDriver Manager -> it will automatically download each driver and works with all browser


3. Selenium GRID
=======================

Grid is that component of selenium which is used only for execution

We dont write sscripts using grid

If you want to execute test cases in distributed environment-> use grid

===========================================

Go to File --> New--> select project --> select maven project

A new maven project template will open

Click on checkbox for - create simple project

Un check default workspace

from the frop down select  toption ending with eclipse workspace

If you dont find it then select it by clicking on Browse button

Click on checkbox og workspace

Press Next button

Enter a unique name for Group ID: selenium-Basics

Artifact ID : selenium-Basics

Always Artifact ID and group id will be same

Click on finish 


In the project Explorer, you will see your maven project

Expand the project now

You will see a file called --> pom.xml file

Double click and open the file
==================================================

On you laptop:
====================================================

Make sure :

> only 1 JAVA version should be there- preffered java version 11

> Set up environment variable : JAVA_HOME and JAVA_PATH

> Install eclipse for java developers 2021 -06

> Create a Mavan project

> Add the Dependencies in POM.xml

> Create your programs.

=================================
> Understand the topic, asks question

> execute the scenario

if any issue, keep the prgram aside --> proceeed to the next one.

trouble shooting at the end 12.45 to 1.30pm
=============================================

HTML Page: Collection of web elements

Elelments     Actions can we perform
========================================================================

TextBox : element is visible or not, enabled or not, input data(char,inte)

Button : element is visible or not, enabled or not, clickable or not

Link : element is visible or not, enabled or not, clickable or not

DropDown: element is visible or not, enabled or not, selection, count the number of choices

CheckBox : element is visible or not, enabled or not, click

Radiobutton: element is visible or not, enabled or not, click

Tables,

Dynamic dropdowns, Calender

==========================================================
Now we want selenium to perform the testing for us:

1. Open the browser

2. Enter the URL

3. Maxamize the browser window

4. Delete cookies of the browser

5. Find the username textbox , check if it displayed or not

6. Find the username textbox , check if it enabled or not

7. Find the username textbox , check if you insert data init or not.

5. Find the passowrd textbox , check if it displayed or not

6. Find the password textbox , check if it enabled or not

7. Find the password textbox , check if you insert data init or not.


================================================

We want selenium to find an element and perform an action on it

How to find the address of the element?

Selenium provides us Locators that will help you find the address of your element on the webpage

There are total 8 locators:

1. id               

2. name

3. linkText

4. Partiallinktext

5. CSS

6. XPATH

7. tagname

8. classname


===========================

Selenium gives following syntax that you will use to provide element address in the script


 driver.findElement(By.locatorname("value"))

findElement : method
By: class
locatorname: locator method
value: we get form the webpage
===========================================
How do we get the value:
============================================
1. Go to the webpage which is to tested

2. select the element to be tested

3. right click on the element --> click inspect

4. At bottom, you will the complete document of the page--> you will be on the element tab

5. You will also see a line which highlighted in blue color

6. The highlighted html tag are the attributes of the element

<input id="wpName2" name="wpName" size="20" class="loginText mw-userlogin-username cdx-text-input__input" placeholder="Enter your username" tabindex="1" required="" autocomplete="username">

Using these attribites we will  find the locator value of the element

=========================================

Suppose i want to find the element using ID locator
=============================================

Element: 			locator:		value

1. username  			id			wpName2

2.password			id   			wpPassword2

3. retype			id 			wpRetype

Suppose I want to find the above element using name locator
=============================================

Element: 			locator:		value

1. username			name			wpName
  			
2.password			name			wpPassword

3. retype			name 			retype

LinkText localtor
=================================
driver.findElement(By.linktext("org.openqa.selenium")

driver.findElement(By.linktext("org.openqa.selenium.bidi.browsingcontext"))

PartialLinktext locator:
================================
This is usefull, when you ahve links with unique text and links have longer text
then we can use partial link text

driver.findElement(By.partialLinktext("selenium");


driver.findElement(By.partialLinktext(".browsingcontext"))

=============================================


XPATh Functions:

===================

Regualr xpath expression:

//tagname[@attribute='exactvalue']

1. starts-with()

//tagname[starts-with(@attribute,'startingtextvalue')]

here we will proivde the starting value of the attribute

for example:

attribute ==> name = name8ca553fc

nameb7cb2d8b

//tagname[starts-with(@name,'login')]

2. contains()

attribute ==> name = login8ca553fc

//tagname[contains(@attribute,'anytextvalue')]

// input[contains(@name,'login')]

3. text() --> used for link elements

//tagname[text()='value']

<a>log in </a>

//a[text()='log in']

<a class="blog-pager-newer-link" href="http://seleniumpractise.blogspot.com/2016/08/how-to-handle-autocomplete-feature-in.html" id="Blog1_blog-pager-newer-link" title="Newer Post">Newer Post</a>

====================================
Xpath Axis
====================================

Suppose an Xpath is returning multiple tags and you want to choose a single in it

Then you can use a new methods

driver.findElements(By.xpath("//tagname[@attribute='value']")).get(1)

driver.findElements(By.xpath("//tagname[@attribute='value']")).get(2)

OR

driver.findElement(By.xpath((//tagname[@attribute='value'])[1]))
driver.findElement(By.xpath((//tagname[@attribute='value'])[2]))


//tagname[@attribute='value']/axisName::tagname[index]

======================================


XPATH Axis: It is a process in which you will travel from one tag to reach your desired element tag 

syntax:  //tagname[@attribute='value]/axisName::tagname

travel downwards in the document we have axis like:
======================
> child ==> find the child tags of parent tags
> descendant ==> find the child and grandchild tags of parenet tag
> following ==> find all the tags after the parent tag has closed

Example:

Pareent node/current node:  (//div[@class='cell'])[3]

Child tag : (//div[@class='cell'])[3]/child::*

Descendant tag: (//div[@class='cell'])[3]/descendant::*

<html>
 <tbody>
  <tr1>
    <td1> </td1>
     <input>  </input>
    <td2> </td2>
      <input>  </input>
 </tr1>
 <tr2>
    <td1> </td1>
      <input>  </input>
   <td2> </td2>
     <input>  </input>
 </tr2>
 <tr3>
   <td1> </td1>
      <input>  </input>
   <td2> </td2>
     <input>  </input>
 </tr3>
</tbody>
</html>

//tbody[attribut='value]/descendant::td1[1]

//tbody[attribut='value]/descendant::input[2]

self	return the same current tag
child	will return all the children of the current node
parent	Will retrun the parent tag of the current node
ancestor	selects all the ancestors of the context node
ancestor-or-self	selects all the ancestors of the context node and itself
descendant	will return all the children and grandchildren of the current node
descendant-or-self	will return all the children of the current node and itself
following	will return all the nodes that apppear after the current node
following-sibling	"will return all the nodes that have :
1. same parent as the current node
2. appear after the conext node"
preceding	will return all the nodes that appear before parent  of the context node and travelling through the root node
preceding sibling	"will return all the nodes that have :
1. same parent as the current node
2. appear before the conext node"










==========================================

CSS Locator:
=======================================

tagname and id attribute

Here # represent id attribute

CSS locator : tagname#idvalue

input#email


2. tag[attribute='value']
input[name='pass']

3. tag.classattributevalue[attribute='value']

here . represent class attribute value

input.sc-jlyJG kxRJeL[id='src']

4. Inspect the element --> rightclick on the element atrribut --> copy --> copy selector

#src

5. #idattributevalue

6. contains() function--> used to fetch text of the element

syntax=>  tagname:contains('text value')

OR use absolute CSS Selector path

#userlogin2 > div > div.mw-htmlform-field-HTMLTextField.loginText.mw-userlogin-username.mw-ui-vform-field > label





Wait time in selenium:
=======================

Waittime help selenium script to be in sync with you application

If our application is takign time to load

or

If elements on the page are taking time to load

Then we have to add waititimes in the script

So that script waits for element/page to be available and then perform the action. In this way script will work wothout any issues.

Various kinds of wait time:
===============================

Java --> Thread.sleep(5000);

Selenium:

Implicit wait:
// Implicit wait is written in the beginning of the script after we open the URL
		// here selenium is going to wait for full 3 seconds before throwing an error that element not found
		// Even if elements are visible on the webpage, selenium will wait for 3 seconds



Explicit wait:
============================

In this type of wait there are 2 conditions:

1. Explicitly wait for the element to be visible and if it is visible then perform the action
2. If element is not visible then continue to wait for given duration

If the condition is satisfied even before the duration is complete, selenium will go ahead and perform the action
Selenium will continue to exeucte the script.

To implement this we use:

WebDriverWait --> create an object of this class
until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityofElement(e1))
wait frot he duration to complete--> throw the error 

Fluent wait:
=============================

FluentWait<WebDriver> wait = new FluentWait<WebDriver>(driver)
    .withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
          .pollingEvery(Duration.ofSeconds(5)).ignoring(NoSuchElementException.class);
          WebElement element = wait.until(new Function<WebDriver, WebElement>() 


     {
   public WebElement apply(WebDriver driver) {
   WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.xpath(""""));
   return element;
   }
     });"

===============================

Selenium cannot interact with desktop applicaions

If we have to upload files from a windows laptop thenw e ahve to integrate selenium with AutoIT

AutoIT tool lets you write a script --> compile the scripts , using which we  will handle and interact with desktop application

First selenium will work on webpage

Then we give control to autoIT tool to perform the desktop related action

===================

As part of thsi scenario: we will go to


https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/

1. Download autoIT

https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/

2. Then on the same page you will click on AutoIt Script Editor.

We need to write the script

On your windows machine search for editor-> scite

It will open the editor:

ControlFocus("Open","","Edit1")
ControlSetText("Open","","Edit1","C:\Users\sonal\Documents\ATE-Phase1-SL\JDBCconnectivity.png")
ControlClick("Open","","Button1")


To find the element--> on windows machine --> search for tool AutoIT windows info --> open it

drag the finder tool on the text box. itwill show details in box: class and instance

so element location is : classinstance => Edit1

Similarly for open button ==> it is Button1

======================

Once the script is ready, save the script on your windows machine

Right click on the script --> clcik on Show more options  and select compile the script.

A compiled file will be available in the folder.
================

This compiled file will be executed in selenium script

Give this code

Runtime.getRuntime().exec("C:\\Users\\sonal\\Desktop\\AutiitScripts\\Scriptupload3.exe");
========================================
Selenium Integrationw ith SikuliX
========================================


This will not work with Maven project

You have to use a Java project

In this project add the selenium jar files

you cannot execute it on you lab machine

It has to be done on windows laptop

We will go to this page https://launchpad.net/sikuli/+download

And download the jar file -->  sikulixide-2.0.5.jar (md5)

Add this jar file to Java project --> go to build path--> select class path --> add the jar --> apply and close



Sikuli interacts with the windows application via images

Which ever element we have to test on desktop application, we have to take an image of it-> using anipping tool

and feed this image to sikuli tool methods

What ever is on the image it will perofrm that action on webpage


So change the resultion of your desktop

go to desktop--> right clik-->display settings --> resolution --> 1280 * 720

After this .. take snapshots of the application

Save the snapshots at a folder

And then pass it to selenium script

Make sure the file to be uploaded shoudl also have resolution same as 1280 * 720


=============================================

You are asked to build an online travel booking website. This website should have various web elements to handle the inputs given by a user.


The Following Requirements Should Be Met: 

Create a Java/Maven Project. 

Add the jar files of the Selenium or dependencies. 

Open the browser and locate the web elements using Locators.  -- Script 1

Create a page object design pattern class to store the web elements of a webpage.  -- not required- SKIP it

Install and configure AutoIT. 

Open the SciTE editor and write the script to select the file from the desktop. 

Save the AutoIT script as .au3 format and compile it. 

Create a class to upload the file by calling .au3 script. 

Create a class to handle web elements. (mouse hover script)

Create a class to handle external elements.  (Alerts)
