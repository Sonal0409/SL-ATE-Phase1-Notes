become a root user:

# sudo su -

Create a working directory[folder]

# mkdir myproject

Go inside the directory

# cd myproject

create empty files

# touch file1.java file2.java

Create a local repo

# git init

===================================================

git configurations:

git config --global user.name sonal


git config --global user.email sonal@gmail.com


Configurations are of 3 types:
================================

Config Variables: user.name and user.email

Local: The configuration when set with flag a local, the config variable will be application only to that particulr repository

Global : The configuration when set with flag as global, the config variable will be application to every repository created by current user logged in the machine

System : The configuration when set with flag as system, the config variable will be application to every repository created by every user logged in the machine


Assignment:
=====================

Remove the configurations:

==========================
git config --global --unset user.name

git config --global --unset user.email


Find out the file/location where the git configuration are saved:
================================

local:

global: cat ~/.gitconfig

system: 


========================================
Adding a file to Local repo
=====================================

# git status

# git add .

OR

# git add -a  // add all the files

# git status

# git commit -m "added file file1 and file2"

==============================================

Take an existing file which is tracked by GIT and do some modifications.
Commit the changes to git
====================================================

Make changes in the file--> add some content in the file

Edit the file

# nano file1.java

Insert any data

To save and exit

Press CTL x

press y

press enter key

Now check git status:

# git status

======================================================

To check the commit history on a git repository
==================================================

# git log

# git log --oneline

Assignment:
===================

1. How can i find log of git commits from one date to another date

--since=<date>, --after=<date>
           Show commits more recent than a specific date.

 --until=<date>, --before=<date>
           Show commits older than a specific date.

2. Move/copy/push your git log history in a new text file

===============================================

Take an exisitng file from local repo and 

Delete it from Local repo and working directory


# git ls-files

Choose a filename to be deleted

Execute the git delete command to delete a file from Local Repo and Working directory

# git rm <filename>

git rm file1.java

File will be removed from LR and WD

# git ls-files   // file will not be LR

# ls                // file will not be in WD

Commit the deletion of file:

# git commit -m "deletion of file"

# git log --oneline

==================================================

Revert command
============================================

1. File --> present in the LR and WD (old state1)

File --> deleted the file from LR and WD (new state)

we got a commit id --> commit2

you want the file back

git revert commit2

Revert command will always work on a commit id

Whatever happened in the commit will go back to its original state.


When you execute the revert command, you are bringing back some chnages to the LR

this command is doing changes to LR, so a new commit has to be created for your REVERT command/action

In this cases, git will automatically create a commit, asking you to enter a message

Git will open a new open a file, where you have to enter the message and save the file



Execution:
===================================

Step 1: Check the commit id that you want to revert

take the deletion commit id

# git log --oneline

copy the seven digits

c9bf927

Step 2: Execute the revert command

# git revert c9bf927

press enter key, it will open a nano editor file

asking you to insert some message

Save the file:  press CTL x ==> press y ==> press enter key

Step 3: fiel will be abck in LR and WD

git ls-files

ls

=================================================

.gitignore
=========================================

In a working directory we will have files which can be shread with others like out source code file, scripts

But we can also have extra files in our workign directory like : .txt files, .xml files, .log file, .class files, test data files

These extra files we dont want them to be version controlled, then we can ask git to ignore them

This concept of ignoreing the files by git is applicable only to new files

Files with status as UNTRACKED.

This concept is performed by creating a file with name as .gitignore

File name will ramin same, its a hidden file, it has no extension

In this file we will write names of the files that we want to ignore
As you will save the file. git will not be bothered about the files that you are ignoring
Git will not prompt your for adding them to LR

Ignored files  Files will be present in the Working directory



Step 1: Create some files that we will ignore

# touch file.txt file2.xml file3.log file4.class

Step 2: Check the status of the files in GIT

# git status

files will be untracked, git is suggesting to add and commit them in local  repo

Step 3: We do not want to add them or commit them, we want to ignore these files

# nano .gitignore

insert below text

*.txt
*.log
*.xml
*.class

Save the file and exit

press CTL x and press y  and press enter key


In this file add names of the files to be ignored
In this file names will added, 1 filename 1 line
Suppose you want to ignore all xml files or all .class files, so entry in the file cna be made like

*.xml
*.class
file.txt
*.txt

As you will save the file, git will start ignoring all the files



Step 4: Check the status now and commit .gitignore file


# git status

# git add .

# git commit -m "done .gitignore"


======================================================

Remote repository:
=======================================================

Creation of github account:
===================================================

Step2: Connect the SL lab to the github account so that we can push the data from local repo to remote repo


On the lab terminal:
====================================
Execute the command to generate SSH keys



Password less authentication between git(lab) and github servers --> SSH method

2 servers have to communicate we also have an authentication method of SSH

SSH command will generate public key and priavte key

copy public key on github account and save it

after this you can communicate with github from your lab terminal with any username or password


Execution:
============================

Step 1: generate SSH keys:

Go to lab terminal

# cd

# ssh-keygen

dont enter any thing.. just keep pressing enter for 3 times

You key will generated

The public key can be seen by exeucting below commad:

# cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Step 2:

Copy the key carefully

ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC7MWRf5oD4jXnFIvIfpZlBvUpb/fiR3WpFiAnZJZ7hYeD7G+WPKjQ5FaYTl7m6g+h4kSwa1VwyoMnjBm/+rdc3r1nVH+HujpBxa39+5tM0pYHFNP/UOc1dqWpOjAZlM3j5OuoTNvBZqZ+vvQ5XQGXHXlk5MtOjxO91rEOqpWuqYewXT9L535vprwavlOKKAEpIKKyNXCITSc4kTiLz9uSVS9utDEnByI9ohYK83DxGcPK2gNlie6vgaM9IdFeTRgJ+538QmzHiHAwAhcRcPBjIRCRisWWiRL6HpYs0e5l1Z1CtHwC2VAb4Ui5vXDmXSP/kPZtWGCEwsX6RLKmonZE7 root@ip-172-31-22-237

Step 3: paste it on git hub

Step 4: Create a remote repository
