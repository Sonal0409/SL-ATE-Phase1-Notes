Array
"Can store multiple values
of any datatypes - primitive and non primitive "
Can store signle type of data
Array size fixed
"sortdata, add the data or delete
There no methods to do that. You have write the algorithm for these operation"

Collection Framework
Store non-primitive data
It can store different types of data
Size is dynamic
Comes with pre-defined methods for add, delete, sort, contains
"Collection: An entity or an Object which store multiple data
Collection framwork: java gives set og libraries, classes and interfaces That helps us to store of data"

ArrayList  - Class
"It is a class which is inheriting methods of List Interface of java
List interface --> implements--> Collection interface"
All of these interfaces and classes ar epresnet in java package -> java.util
Array list is a class that will help to store multiple data. 
The size of arraylist is growable
"Arraylist also store values using the index
Index-based data structure -> like an array"
"Array will store -> single datatype
Array list is hetrogenous-> different dataype values can be stored"
Duplicate values can be stored in the array list
any number of Null values can be stored
It follows insertion order and also follows an index order to fect the data
It provides methods to perform operation like insert, delete, search


Linked List
Linked list is a class implementing methods of List interface and deque interface.
List interface inherity Collection interface
It is part of java.util package
The underline datastructure is doubly linked list or circular linked list
Stores the data as a Node
Element insertion and deletion is very fast in linked list
We can traverse in forward and backward direction
It is an index based datastructure like arraylist
We can store any kind of datatype
duplicate lements can be stored
null values can be stored
Doesnot sort the list
